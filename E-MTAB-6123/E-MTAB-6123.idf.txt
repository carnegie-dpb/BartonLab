Experiment Description	Arabidopsis transcription factor SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) expression was induced using the dexamethasone-inducible TGV system in the Ler background and differentially expressed genes were identified compared to an induced empty-vector control line at each time point using RMA and LIMMA analysis.

Protocol Description	According to Affymetrix instructions.	According to Affymetrix instructions.	According to Affymetrix instructions.	Plants were grown at 22 degrees celsius under continuous white light.	60 um (micromolar) dexamethasone was added as a solution to agar plates containing plants (~5 ml per plate)	Total RNA was extracted with Tripure Reagent (Roche). RNA was further purified using 2M LiCl (final concentration). RNA was dissolved in water.	RMA and LIMMA were used subsequently to analyse data.	All samples were harvested at 9 days after sowing. Inductions with 60 um DEX were performed such that all samples were the same age when harvested.
